    <h3>Summary:</h3>The year is 1893 and India is under British occupation. In a small village, the tyrannical
    Captain Russell (Paul Blackthorne) has imposed an unprecedented land tax on its citizens. Outraged, Bhuvan
    (Aamir Khan), a rebellious farmer, rallies the villagers to publicly oppose the tax. Russell offers a novel way
    to settle the dispute: he challenges Bhuvan and his men to a game of cricket, a sport completely foreign to
    India.
    If Bhuvan and his men can defeat Russell's team, the tax will be repealed.
